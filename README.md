# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

In this project, we will analysed a dataset about the westbound traffic of the I-94 Interstate highway. The dataset was made available by John Hogue and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).

Our analysis aimed to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. Understanding what indicators contribute to the severity of traffic could aid in making informed and data-driven decisions on how to prepare and potentially reduce the impact of these.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
* Line Graphs and Time Series
* Scatter Plots and Correlations
* Bar Plots, Histograms and Distributions
* Pandas Visualisations and Grid Charts
